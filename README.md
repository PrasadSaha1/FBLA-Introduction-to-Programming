# FBLA-Introduction-to-Programming
Greetings! My name is Prasad Saha. I am a sophomore at Monroe-Woodbury High School, and is this is my project for NYS FBLA Introduction to Programming. <br>
The task was to create a program for students at my school to calculate their weighted and unweighted GPA. This calculator does that using Monroe-Woodbury's grading system. <br>
For a simple experience, users can go to Quarterly GPA, which is made for a single quarter. A more comphrensive GPA can be found if the user clicks Annual/Cumulative GPA. This program defaults to MW's grading scale, but the user can adjust the grading scale throughout the program. It also saves the user's data with a file. <br>
This program was made using Python's Tkinter module, which is a module that creates GUIs. To run this program, copy the code and the error.png image into a complier. I used Pycharm to make this program, but it should work with other compliers.  <br>
Tkinter is a built in module, but I've noticed that many online compliers do not support Tkinter. If that is the case, you will have to use an IDE such as Pycharm or vs code. <br>
Note that throughout the code, there are refrenences to a way for the user to export their data as a PDF, which was never finished but kept in the code if it was to be added later. It uses some modules that require pip, but you shouldn't have to install these modules as they are commented out and not used in the program.
