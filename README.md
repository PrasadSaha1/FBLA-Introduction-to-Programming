# FBLA-Introduction-to-Programming
Greetings! My name is Prasad Saha. I am a sophomore at Monroe-Woodbury High School, and this is my project for NYS FBLA Introduction to Programming. <br>
The task was to create a program for students at my school to calculalte their weighted and unweighted GPA using my school's grading system. This calculator allows users to calculate their GPA on both the quarterly and cumulative scope. <br>
Besides the Monroe-Woodbury scale, the user can customize the information. They can go to the settings and change the weight of honors and AP classes. They can also change the scale from 100.0 to 4.0. This allows MW students to compare their GPA to those of other schools.
The modules needed for this project are Tkinter and Reportlab, which can be installed using pip. The IDE used for this project was PyCharm, however, any IDE should work.
