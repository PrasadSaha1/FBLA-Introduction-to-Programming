Greetings! My name is Prasad Saha, and I am a sophomore at Monroe-Woodbury High School. This is my project for NYS FBLA Introduction to Programming 2023-2024. <br>
**Task** The task was to create a program for students at my school to calculate their weighted and unweighted GPA using my school's grading system. 
**Correlation** This calculator allows users to calculate their GPA on both the quarterly and cumulative scope. 
Besides the Monroe-Woodbury scale, the user can customize the information. They can go to the settings and change the weight of honors and AP classes. They can also change the scale from 100.0 to 4.0. This allows MW students to compare their GPA to those of other schools. <br>
**Tools** This project was done in Python. The modules used for this project are Tkinter and Reportlab, which can be installed using pip. The IDE used for this project was PyCharm, however, any IDE should work. <br>
