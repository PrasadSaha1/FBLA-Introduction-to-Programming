Greetings! My name is Prasad Saha, and I am a sophomore from Monroe-Woodbury High School in New York. This is my project for  FBLA Introduction to Programming 2023-2024. <br>

**Task** The task was to create a program for students at my school to calculate their weighted and unweighted GPA using my school's grading system. <br

**Correlation** This calculator allows users to calculate their GPA on both the quarterly and cumulative scope. 
Besides the Monroe-Woodbury scale, the user can customize the information. They can go to the settings and change the weight of honors and AP classes. They can also change the scale from 100.0 to 4.0. This allows MW students to compare their GPA to those of other schools. <br>

**Tools** This project was done in Python. The modules used for this project were Pyside6, openpyxl, reportlab, csv, and mysql.connector. All of these can be installed with pip. The IDE used for this project was PyCharm, however, any IDE should work. <br>
