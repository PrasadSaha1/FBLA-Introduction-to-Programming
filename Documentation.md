**Changing the Screen** At the start of the program, various instances of QWidget() are created. These instances are added to a stacked_widget(), whose index is changed with the change_screen() function. The identifiers of the QWidget() instances are lowercase, but the indexes that will act as parameters for change_screen() are uppercase for readability.

**Saving Data** The program saves data both locally and through an account system. The data is saved locally through CSV files. A seperate file is made for class data and user data (including information in the settings, GPA scale, colors, etc.). At the end of the program, all of this data is added to the file, and the user can access this data by clicking Import Local Data. The account system uses MySQL. A database is defined and throughout the program, data is added and deleted from the database once every two seconds. This also occurs at the end of the program. Like with CSV, all previous data is saved.
